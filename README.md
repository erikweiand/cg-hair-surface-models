This repository contains the relevant files for studying wetting and surface structure of the 18-MEA monolayer on hair by means of coarse-grained molecular simulations (CGMD) in LAMMPS. The corresponding publication preprint can be found at [ChemRxiv](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2021-7jpc1 "ChemRxiv") (last updated 2022/01/24).

## Content
The following subdirectories are available at the moment:
- 01_CGMD_Simulations/ - Coarse-grained molecular dynamics initial configurations and LAMMPS input files for monolayer simulations in vacuum and with water/n-hexadecane droplets.
- 02_AAMD_Simulations/ - All atom (AA) reference simulation initial topology files and LAMMPS input scripts of fully-functionalized monolayers in vacuum and with water droplets. The OPLS force field and SPC/E water are used in agreement with [2].
- 03_Initial_Configurations/ - Initial configurations and corresponding workflow descriptions for hair surfaces and liquid bulk systems.
- 04_Post_Processsing/ - MATLAB post-processing scripts, primarily for contact angle analysis from LAMMPS trajectory files (.traj).

Further workflow descriptions are added in *README.txt* files in the subdirectories and will be merged into this document in the future. For making full use of this repository, the following tools should be accessible to the user:
- LAMMPS (https://www.lammps.org/)
- Moltemplate (https://www.moltemplate.org/)
- packmol (https://www.moltemplate.org/)
- MATLAB (https://de.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- A molecular visualization tool, such as VMD (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)

Open-source accessibility for the post-processing routines is currently not planned but should not be a great challenge to achieve by transferring the MATLAB scripts to Python/NumPy.
